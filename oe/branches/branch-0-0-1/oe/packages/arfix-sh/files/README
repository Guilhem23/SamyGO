
WiseLink video player aspect ratio fix version 1.1
==================================================

Patch to original Samsung firmware T-RBYDEUC-1013.1
for Samsung's LCD TV sets LExxA756, LExxA856 and LExxA956


What is changed
---------------
WiseLink video player has 3 new items for fixed aspect ratios in Tools menu:
4:3, 16:9 (also fullscreen), 2.21:1
For MPEG2 source aspect ratio flag in sequence header (01b3) is taken
into account in auto fit mode.
Otherwise if PAL resolution (720x576) is detected in Auto fit mode,
aspect ratio 4:3 is used.


Known problems
--------------
When playing H.264 content, original scaling control routines return an error
and video is played fullscreen independently of menu setting.


Instructions
------------
For safety of first tests I prefer dynamic patching in TV memory instead
of permanent firmware patch.
I recommend you to enable telnet/ssh access first although any way to start
a shell script inside TV is sufficient.

Unpack zip content to an USB flash or to a network share and insert/mount
it to TV. Change to patch directory and run arfix.sh

# cd /dtv/usb/sdb1/T-RBYDEUC-1013.1-arfix_1.1/
# ls -l

Changes will be lost after exeDSP restart (TV off/on).


Applying permanently
--------------------
If you have verified the patch works, you can copy patch files to
/mtd_rwarea or /mtd_exe (is writable on this model)
and call arfix.sh from you customized boot script.
Don't call arfix.sh before initialization of exeDSP is completed!
A 20 second delay from start exeDSP should be sufficient.

You can also apply patch to exeDSP file. See elfpatcher -h and DIY
or wait until patch is integrated into SamyGO Firmware Patcher.


Warranty
--------
None as usual. Do it at your own risk.
