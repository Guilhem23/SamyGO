
WiseLink video player aspect ratio fix
======================================

Patch to original Samsung firmware T-RBYDEUC-1013.1
for Samsung's LCD TV sets LExxA756, LExxA856 and LExxA956


What is changed
---------------
WiseLink video player has 3 new items for fixed aspect ratios in Tools menu:
4:3, 16:9 (also fullscreen), 2.21:1
If PAL resolution (720x576) is detected in Auto fit mode, aspect ratio 4:3
is used.


Known problems
--------------
When playing H.264 content, original scaling control routines return an error
and video is played fullscreen independently of menu setting.


Instructions
------------
For safety of first tests I prefer dynamic patching in TV memory instead
of permanent firmware patch.
I recommend you to enable telnet/ssh access first although any way to start
a shell script inside TV is sufficient.

Unpack zip content to an USB flash or to a network share and insert/mount
it to TV. Change to patch directory and run arfix.sh

# cd /dtv/usb/sdb1/T-RBYDEUC-1013.1-arfix_1.0/
# ls -l

Changes will be lost after exeDSP restart (TV off/on).


Applying permanently
--------------------
If you have verified the patch works, you can copy patch files to
/mtd_rwarea or /mtd_exe (is writable on this model)
and call arfix.sh from you customized boot script.
Don't call arfix.sh before initialization of exeDSP is completed!
A 20 second delay from start exeDSP should be sufficient.

You can also apply patch to exeDSP file. See elfpatcher -h and DIY
or wait until patch is integrated into SamyGO Firmware Patcher.


Warranty
--------
None as usual. Do it at your own risk.
