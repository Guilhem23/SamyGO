
WiseLink video player aspect ratio fix version 1.2
==================================================

Patch to original Samsung firmware T-RBYDEUC-1013.1
for Samsung's LCD TV sets LExxA756, LExxA856 and LExxA956


What is changed
---------------
WiseLink video player has 3 new items for fixed aspect ratios in Tools menu:
4:3, 16:9 (also fullscreen), 2.21:1
For MPEG2 source aspect ratio flag in sequence header (01b3) is taken
into account in auto fit mode.
Otherwise if PAL resolution (720x576) is detected in Auto fit mode,
aspect ratio 4:3 is used.

The patch also fixes an error which prevented scaling of some video
formats (e.g. H264 in MPEG TS container)



Applying permanently
--------------------
Use SamyGO Firmware Patcher to patch original firmware and then
proceed with standard firmware update.


In-memory patching
------------------
For safety of first tests I prefer dynamic patching in TV memory instead
of permanent firmware patch.
I recommend you to enable telnet/ssh access first although any way to start
a shell script inside TV is sufficient.

Unpack zip content to an USB flash or to a network share and insert/mount
it to TV. Change to patch directory and run arfix.sh

# cd /dtv/usb/sdb1/T-RBYDEUC-1013.1-arfix_1.2/
# ls -l

Changes will be lost after exeDSP restart (TV off/on).

If you have verified the patch works, you can copy patch files to
/mtd_rwarea or /mtd_exe (is writable on this model)
and call arfix.sh from you customized boot script.
Don't call arfix.sh before initialization of exeDSP is completed!
A 20 second delay from start exeDSP should be sufficient.

You can also apply patch to exeDSP file. If you are experienced
in embedded linux, see elfpatcher -h and DIY.
