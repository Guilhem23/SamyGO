rcSGO is the "universal" start-script for starting telnetd and 
other [SamyGO] extensions (if installed).
the system is modular, you need this script and the core-package
named SamyGO-UPNP-Extension (or the All-Extensions pack). 
other packages are optional.

put your own init-scripts into SamyGO/etc/init.d/ there
will be automaticaly executed if you follow the naming convention:
<nn>_<nn>_<whatewer>.init (nn controls start order)

you can source /dtv/SGO.env to get SYSROOT 
and get PATH + LD_LIBRARY_PATH exported

don't forget to study the README files and scripts :-)

v0.02 comes with starter library for the game gallery
you can start telnetd without patching your firmware.

move SamyGO directory to usb-pen
on tv go content -> setup -> usb
in categorie games select SamyGO-Extensions
on your remote press OK and from dropdown-menue Play

you can copy the the application also to your tv's
flash memory -> yellow button...

or

enable temporary telnet (rename SamyGO/etc/rc.sysinit to
SamyGO/etc/rc.sysinit.off and start the extensions from gallery)
 
copy SamyGO/rcSGO to /mtd_rwarea/rcSGO and patch your firmwares exe.img
to call '/mtd_rwarea/rcSGO &' instead of '/etc/telnetd_start.sh &'

don't forget to rename SamyGO/etc/rc.sysinit.off to SamyGO/etc/rc.sysinit
