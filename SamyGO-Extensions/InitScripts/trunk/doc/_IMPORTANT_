what are "SamyGO Extensions"?
	"SamyGO Extensions" enhance your tv's functionality _without_ patching or
		modify the firmware!

where can you find "SamyGO Extensions"?
	the released version:
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/samygo/files/
	latest beta:
		http://linux.zsolttech.com/Samsung/

can you brick your tv with this extensions?
	answer is simple:
		no, but it can kill you cat, burn your house and make horny things
			with your girlfriend! in worst case you tv shut down and 
			power on again.
	       	except you make changes in the scripts and you didn't know what you done
		if you change any of the scripts you also loose the "arris warranty" ;-)
		if you need assistance for your own scripts you can ask in:
			http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/samygo/viewforum.php?f=4
			but ask _before_ you bricked your tv!

is this stuff compatible with your tv?
	generaly binaries and kernel modules are for ARM architecture
	look at the samsung site, download and extract the firmware for your tv and
	check the resulting directory name:
		T-PRLAUS	-> binaries may work, kernel modules rather not
		T-AMBAUSC	-> binaries may work, kernel modules may also

		T-CHE7AUSC, T-CHE6AUSC, T-CHE7AUSC, T-CHU7DEUC, T-CHL7DEUC
				-> binaries yes, kernel yes (pls. search in forum, i made all 
				   tests on UExxB7020 => T-CHU7DEUC)

		T-CHUCIPDEUC	-> binaries may work, kernel modules may also
			
		T-AMBDFR	-> binaries not, kernel modules also not (Renesas SH not ARM)
		T-RBYDEU	-> binaries not, kernel modules also not (Renesas SH not ARM)

	your tv have to support games in "content library" and "usb movie", 
	pls. consult the manual

general usage:
	extract the zip file to usb-pen
	mv SamyGO directory into the root-directory of the usb-pen 
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory)
	connect usb-pen to tv
	wait few seconds for automatic usb connection menu on tv
	select "content library"
	go to usb -> games, and select "SamyGO Extensions" (with "ok" button on remote-control)
	after the colored screen goes away
		(this is true up to SamyGO All Extensions v0.03,
		later versions will have some kind of control-panel)
	exit from "content library" and go to "media play" ("media.p" button on remote-control)
	select source (red button on remote-control)
	depends on your network services you can see new usb-sources (this are "faked" devices)
		"UPNP Server"
		"Samba Server"
		"NFS Server"
		select one of them, select what you want to see (pictures, music or video)
			than you should see your server(s)...

copy extensions to tv's flash memory:
	on some models it is possible to copy contents to tv's memory in the
	same way you can copy "SamyGO All Extensions" pack to flash
	yellow button ..., pls. look into the manual or search in forum	

1. read here:
	http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/samygo/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=96#p540
	so you now know how to disable unneeded services.

2. file attributes:
	don't copy/extract the extensions on ntfs formated usb-hd just vfat (fat32)
		keep the execute attributes correct!
	the init-scripts have the execute bit to set, this is already done
		but if you extracted the archive to a NTFS formated usb-hd this setting
		is lost! (tv mounts ntfs with special options)
		so you have to use an usb-pen or reformat your usb-hd with 
		vfat before use it.

3. media file sizes:
	upnp (djmount), cifs and nfs, i tested video files up to 8813360067 bytes (h264/720p mkv).
	server software:
		upnp: ushare 1.1a (DLNA disabled!)
		cifs: samba-server 3.2.3
		nfs:  kernel level nfs server (nfsd4)

	ff and seek is (over wifi network) tedious, you can play around with mount parameters
	in:
		SamyGO/etc/init.d/04_04_samba.init
		SamyGO/etc/init.d/03_03_nfsmount.init

	if you can't access/play your big fat files try to split them,
		problem is at server side not in "SamyGO Extensions" ;-)

4. subtitles:
	tested *.srt files -> no problem over upnp (djmount), cifs and nfs
	naming sheme:
		Step_into_Liquid_1080.srt
		Step_into_Liquid_1080.wmv

5. is your network storage device supported by the extensions:
	upnp devices should be ok, if your device is advertised as "DLNA Certified"
	than may not, try to disable DLNA in sutch devices.
	support for twonky will be silently dropped due fact that in google cache
