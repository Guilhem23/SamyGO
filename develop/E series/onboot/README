Use all stuff at your own risk!

Ask on forum before to flash!

customised bootloader for E series ECHOP boards (UExxES7xxx/8xxx)

1. custom onboot, kernel hash checks removed (/dev/mmcblk0/1)
2. 2nd onboot, extended features (explanation coming...) (/dev/mmcblk0/2)
	-usb driver included
	-toggle boot partitions
	-boot nfs rootfs
	-other u-boot similar stuff
3. serial download tool: boot your TV with kernel, uploaded trough serial ExLink cable. cp2102 driver based dongles only, not for profilic based!


to enter bootloader: press and hold "-" 
 
IMPORTANT: flash both botloaders at same tv session and keep this sequence:	
1. flash first onboot (onboot.bin.1024.cmac.img) to /dev/mmcblk0/1
2. flash second onboot (2nd_onboot.img) to /dev/mmcblk0/2

if no errors, reboot tv and pray...

more info comming.
